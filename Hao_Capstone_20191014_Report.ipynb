    "When looking at the table more carefully, the neighborhood name is not always regular. For example, some of these are A/B pattern. Such pattern may cause problem when getting the Latitude/Longitude information from the Geocode. In this case, it will be splitted into 2 more new columns for A & B. There are some neighborhoods have parenthesis, and it may cause similar issues. This will also be taken care of using the lambda function. Once all the columns are created, a loop with priority will be set to get the geocode information. \n",

    "The next step will use the Foursquare credential to get the venues information for all the neighborhoods. Foursquare can help us to get the venues with given latitude/longitude, the output is json format. We can flat that format to get data frame, grab the key information we need, and prepare a new data frame.\n",

The third one has 11, which indicates the activities around the Banking. Considering it as the oil Capital city, one can imagine how busy the banks are. The fourth group shows the coffee and fast food. The fifth one which has a number as 6, shows the real life of Houstonians, they go to supermarkets, home furniture stores, etc. The smallest one, which only has a number 2, reflects the only popular visiting area of Houston, the Memorial park area. It has a big zoo, a good outdoor park, and museums nearby. This is the place people looking for relaxation with family.\n",

For people who likes various food, they probably will have a good impression of the city. If that's a business trip, then it's perfect probably. For anyone who likes to shopping, Houston is also a good choice, it has everything from regular to luxury. Overall, people will find the part they like Houston, and the part Houston is missing.\n",

The local people can get benefits as well.\n",
